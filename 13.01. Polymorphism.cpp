ðŸ”¹ What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means "many forms".
It allows one interface (function or operator) to act differently based on the object type that is using it.
In C++, polymorphism allows you to perform a single action in different ways â€” for example,
calling the same function name but performing different tasks depending on the object.
ðŸ”¸ Types of Polymorphism in C++
C++ supports two main types of polymorphism:
| Type                                      | When it happens          | Achieved By                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism** | During compilation       | Function Overloading, Operator Overloading |
| **2. Run-time (Dynamic) Polymorphism**    | During program execution | Virtual Functions (Function Overriding)    |

| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism** | The function call is resolved at **compile time**.                         | Function Overloading, Operator Overloading |
| **2. Run-time (Dynamic) Polymorphism**    | The function call is resolved at **run time** using **virtual functions**. | Virtual Function (Method Overriding)       |
